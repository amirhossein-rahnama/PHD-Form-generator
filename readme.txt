the application that I used for connecting to phpmyadmin and apache is mamp and you should just put your port on 3307 because this is what I used and the application is straight forward at very beginning it ask for the name of form and and number of elements in next page you should write the label and type for each element the in next page it ask for attributes of the given elements then after filling you should click submit and you will be able to see the results and for sql I used two diffrent tables which are the first one is just for form name and id and the second one is for the elements of it watch out that two tables connected to each  other with primay key which are id for form and formid for formelement tables ,at the end you should be able to see the results perfectly
